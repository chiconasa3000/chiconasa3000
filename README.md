### Hi 🖖, my name is Christian. 

I am a curious developer building software for you and me. I am building my skills yet in different programming languages. One day I will be a great developer. For the moment, I am a hobbit programmer.

I learned some languages such as Python, C++, Java for my first projects at university, I learned too about TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for research projects. Finally, I am playing with GraphQl, Vue, React for my backend and frontend skills.
